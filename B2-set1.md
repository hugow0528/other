Here are the answers and explanations for the Oxford Advanced HKDSE Practice Papers Set 1 Paper 1 Part B2 exercise.

### **Text 4 Analysis & Answers**

**44. What does 'ditching gratuities' in line 1 mean?**
*   **Answer:** Getting rid of tipping / Stopping the practice of tipping / Eliminating tips.
*   **Explanation:** "Gratuities" is another word for tips. "Ditching" means to get rid of something. The text discusses restaurants that have stopped accepting tips.

**45. According to paragraph 1, why have prices at Le Pigeon been raised by 20 per cent?**
*   **Answer:** To pay the staff's higher hourly wages (and commissions) to offset the loss of tips.
*   **Explanation:** The text states that they "threw out tipping... while prices have increased by about 20%." It immediately follows with "Servers are now paid an hourly wage...". The price increase covers the cost of these higher wages without tip revenue.

**46. The writer uses the phrase 'so heavily embedded in the culture' (line 9) to ...**
*   **Answer:** **B** (point out that change may not be easy.)
*   **Explanation:** The text calls it a "bold experiment" with "mixed results" because tipping is so deeply rooted ("embedded") in the culture, implying that changing such a strong habit is difficult.

**47. What does 'Fortgang's sentiment' (line 14) refer to?**
*   **Answer:** His belief that restaurant jobs should be professionalized and compensation should be similar to other professions.
*   **Explanation:** In the paragraph immediately preceding (para 3), Fortgang says, "The hope was to professionalize their jobs and make their method of compensation more in line with nearly every other profession out there."

**48. Which phrase in paragraphs 6–7 refers to servers and waitstaff?**
*   **Answer:** front-of-house employees
*   **Explanation:** Paragraph 6 contrasts "front-of-house employees" (who make hundreds) with "kitchen staff".

**49. Explain the conflict servers and cooks experienced regarding 'the income disparity' (line 24).**
*   **Answer:** Servers earned significantly more money (hundreds of dollars per night) than cooks/kitchen staff (who often made less than $20 per hour).
*   **Explanation:** The text highlights the "income gap" where servers take home large amounts of cash from tips while cooks earn a lower fixed hourly wage.

**50. Select the option that best completes the sentence to show the meaning of 'momentous' (line 24).**
*   **Answer:** **B** (substantial.)
*   **Explanation:** "Momentous" here refers to the size or significance of the gap. "Substantial" means of considerable importance, size, or worth, fitting the context of a large wage gap.

**51. Complete the summary (Paragraphs 9–10):**
*   **(i) hourly** (Text: "work full time for $15 per *hour*")
*   **(ii) training** (Text: "cross-*trained* his employees" -> underwent training)
*   **(iii) efficiently** (Text: "become more *efficient*" -> run more efficiently)

**52. What does 'it' (line 32) refer to?**
*   **Answer:** The new 'one house' model / The new no-tipping system.
*   **Explanation:** The speaker is commenting on the experience of working under the new system described in the previous paragraph ("At first it was a little weird...").

**53. What does the phrase 'customers will end up paying the same amount' (lines 34–35) imply about the customers' paying habits in the past?**
*   **Answer:** They used to tip approximately 20% on top of their bill.
*   **Explanation:** Since menu prices were raised by roughly 20% to compensate for the removal of tips, and the total cost to the customer remained the same, the customer must have previously been adding a 20% tip.

**54.**
*   **i) Metaphor:** **withdrawal**
*   **ii) Comparison:** It compares the habit of tipping to an addiction (like to drugs). Customers are used to the "rush" or power of monetarily rewarding/punishing servers, and stopping that practice causes discomfort similar to withdrawal symptoms.

**55. Which of the following does the writer NOT imply in paragraph 12?**
*   **Answers:** **ii** and **iv**
*   **Explanation:**
    *   (ii) is incorrect because the text argues employees *need* tips to make a living wage, implying they are *not* well compensated by their base pay alone.
    *   (iv) is incorrect (or not implied) because while it says the US needs to rethink the system, it does not claim the system is *only* popular in the US in this specific paragraph.

**56. According to paragraph 13, why is 'the pop-up scene' (line 40) changing attitudes towards tipping?**
*   **Answer:** Because most pop-up restaurants do not have servers (they just have a kitchen), so there is no service to tip for.

**57. Summary Table:**
*   **(i) stayed with her / did not quit** (Para 15: "every one of her employees stuck with her")
*   **(ii) a percentage / a share** (Para 15: "percentage of sales")
*   **(iii) eliminated racism and discrimination** (Para 16: "she's also removed racism and discrimination")

**58.**
*   **i) Who is judging them?** Customers / Diners.
*   **ii) Example:** Servers might judge customers based on their race or appearance to guess if they will tip well, and adjust their service accordingly.

**59. What is the main idea of paragraph 17?**
*   **Answer:** **C** (introduce a contrasting viewpoint.)
*   **Explanation:** The paragraph starts with "Yet..." and introduces the word "disaster," shifting the focus from the success stories (delight) to the failures (disaster).

**60. Why did Thad Volger suggest that he was 'naive' (line 56)?**
*   **Answer:** He thought his staff would stay for the new model/mission, but he underestimated their desire/need for the higher earnings they could get from tips elsewhere.

**61. Diagram Completion (Paragraphs 18–20):**
*   **(i) eventually quit / quit** (Text: "eventually quit")
*   **(ii) lower / less** (Text implies they could get "more money" elsewhere, so wages here were lower)
*   **(iii) strain / pressure** (Text: "strain on the hiring managers")
*   **(iv) dining culture / desire to tip** (Text: "Guests prefer to leave something. It's part of American dining culture")

**62.**
*   **i) Attitude:** He disliked the policy / It annoyed him.
*   **ii) Reason:** He feels he has no recourse (way to punish/provide feedback) if he receives poor service.

**63. Which of the following best summarizes Michael Lynn's message in paragraph 23?**
*   **Answer:** **C** (Many customers feel uncomfortable with no-tipping policies.)
*   **Explanation:** The text says 53% liked the idea, which implies a significant portion (47%) did *not* like it. Additionally, the text notes that people tip out of "guilt and obligation," suggesting that navigating these social norms is fraught with discomfort, and removing them is controversial (as seen with Joe's Crab Shack). *Note: B is incorrect because Lynn explicitly states people tip due to social pressure, NOT to reward service.*

**64. According to Michael Lynn's research, what type of restaurants will benefit from a no-tipping policy?**
*   **Answer:** Fine dining restaurants where servers are highly paid relative to kitchen staff and where customers are wealthy.

**65. What is the tone of Andrew Fortgang in paragraph 26?**
*   **Answer:** **A** (optimistic)
*   **Explanation:** He predicts that in 5-10 years, nearly all fine dining restaurants will adopt this model.

**66. Restaurant Selection:**
*   **i) None** (No restaurant mentioned went out of business; they just changed policies or lost staff).
*   **ii) Joe's Crab Shack** (Reversed its decision).
*   **iii) Park Kitchen** (Experienced staff losses/turnover).

**67. Matching Persons to Statements:**
*   **i) Andrew Fortgang:** **F** (Restaurant servers should be paid the same way as other professions.)
*   **ii) Chris Hannemann:** **A** (I had never thought of such idea before, but the new pay really impressed me.)
*   **iii) LaValle Linn:** **D** (I think America needs to change its dining culture.)
*   **iv) Jennifer Bennett Piallat:** **C** (Our workplace is now a happier and safer place for staff to work.)
*   **v) Lucas Jushinska:** **B** (I feel that tipping is still a good way to give feedback to the server.)

**68. Do you think a no-tipping policy is a good idea? Provide evidence.**
*   *Sample Answer:* **Yes**, because it creates a fairer workplace. The text mentions it helps close the "income disparity" between servers and cooks (Para 8) and can eliminate "racism and discrimination" (Para 16) caused by servers judging customers or feeling pressured to tolerate bad behavior for tips.
*   *Alternative Answer:* **No**, because it restricts customer choice. As noted in the text, some customers feel "rubbed the wrong way" (Para 22) because they lose the ability to punish poor service. Additionally, it can cause staff to quit if they can earn more money elsewhere (Para 18).
