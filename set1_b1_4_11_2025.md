<summary><b>Question 25</b></summary>

> What is the topic of the forum?
> A Choosing the perfect piece of gym equipment
> B Renovating the covered playground
> C Managing after-school clubs
> D Improving students’ health and well-being

**Answer:** D - Improving students’ health and well-being

**Location/Reasoning:** While creating a gym (the specific subject) is discussed, the overall goal is broader. FitBoy states in lines 7-8, "We all know that if we’re fit and healthy, we also perform better academically. This will really help us!" This points to the wider topic of student health and well-being.

<summary><b>Question 28</b></summary>

> What does the word ‘It’ (line 3) refer to?

**Answer:** The storeroom (next to the covered playground).

**Location/Reasoning:** The preceding sentence (lines 2-3) says, "We could convert the storeroom next to the covered playground into a gym." The word "It" in the next sentence refers back to this storeroom.
</details>

<summary><b>Question 29</b></summary>

> Which of the following is NOT mentioned as necessary for the new gym by RedReader’s post in lines 15–20?
> A the decor should be new and attractive
> B the area should have a fresh smell
> C the temperature should be controlled
> D there should not be any mess or dirt

**Answer:** B - the area should have a fresh smell

**Location/Reasoning:** In lines 15-20, RedReader mentions the gym should be "air-conditioned" (C), "bright, modern" (A), and "clean" (D). There is no mention of how the gym should smell.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Question 30</b></summary>

> Why does JonasJoy ask ‘What planet are you living on?’ (line 21)?

**Answer:** To show that he thinks the idea of creating a gym is unrealistic or impractical due to its high cost.

**Location/Reasoning:** JonasJoy immediately follows this question by stating, "Creating a gym will cost a fortune! I don’t think we have enough budget for that." (lines 21-23). The phrase is used to express disbelief at how unrealistic he finds the suggestion.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Question 31</b></summary>

> Which word in lines 21–26 has a similar meaning to ‘sensible’?

**Answer:** prudent

**Location/Reasoning:** In line 25, JonasJoy suggests an alternative plan and concludes, "It would be a prudent use of this money." The word "prudent" means acting with or showing care and thought for the future, which is synonymous with being sensible.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Question 32</b></summary>

> A money to help pay someone’s costs
> B an object that holds something up in position
> C encouragement and help for a plan
> D help that someone receives to use computers or other technological products correctly

**Answer:** C - encouragement and help for a plan

**Location/Reasoning:** In line 27, FitBoy says, "Thanks to everyone for your support and interest in this idea." He is thanking other students for their positive engagement and helpful suggestions regarding his plan to create a gym.

> A Louisa_M and ClariceCC
> B RedReader and JonasJoy
> C Louisa_M and RedReader
> D ClariceCC and JonasJoy

**Answer:** C - Louisa_M and RedReader

**Location/Reasoning:** Before this post on March 12, Louisa_M showed support ("I like the idea of a gym.") and RedReader gave constructive ideas. JonasJoy was negative, and ClariceCC had not posted yet. Therefore, the thanks for support are directed at Louisa_M and RedReader.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Question 34</b></summary>

> Which word in lines 27–32 has a similar meaning to ‘special offers’?

**Answer:** deals

**Location/Reasoning:** In line 31, FitBoy says he will "see what deals there are." In this context, "deals" refers to special offers or discounts on equipment. The word "discount" in the next line also fits.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Question 35</b></summary>

> What is the main idea of lines 33–39? ClariceCC wants to ...
> A vote for FitBoy as the project’s leader.
> B remind FitBoy that the area available is not large.
> C tell the other students that she cannot help.
> D suggest some good hand weights and kettlebells.

**Answer:** B - remind FitBoy that the area available is not large.

**Location/Reasoning:** ClariceCC's main point is about the practical limitations of space. She states, "our space will probably be limited. Space is so valuable in Hong Kong!" (lines 34-35) and warns that treadmills "take up too much room" (line 37). Her suggestion for smaller items is a solution to this main problem.
</details>

> Which of the following is NOT mentioned in Louisa_M’s post in lines 40–44?
> A choosing good-quality equipment
> B making FitBoy the project’s leader
> C offering to help
> D agreeing with ClariceCC

**Answer:** D - agreeing with ClariceCC

**Location/Reasoning:** In her post (lines 40-44), Louisa_M mentions making FitBoy leader (B), volunteering to help (C), and focusing on quality equipment (A). She does not mention or respond to ClariceCC's previous post about space limitations.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Question 37</b></summary>

> Who or what does the word ‘them’ (line 47) refer to?

**Answer:** (our) school sports teams

**Location/Reasoning:** In lines 46-47, RedReader suggests, "...ask our school sports teams what equipment would help them improve their performance. This might give them the edge..." The word "them" refers directly back to "our school sports teams."
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Question 38</b></summary>

> According to the forum, are the following statements True (T), False (F) or Not Given (NG)?

| iii) RedReader is a member of a school sports team. | | | ⚫ |
| iv) FitBoy has all the information on gym equipment. | | ⚫ | |

**Reasoning:**
*   i) **False:** In line 13, Louisa_M describes the roof as an "underutilized space."
*   ii) **True:** In line 24, JonasJoy mentions, "There are already some monkey bars and yoga mats there."
*   iii) **Not Given:** In lines 45-47, RedReader suggests asking the sports teams for input, but never states that he is a member of one.

**Reasoning:**
*   i) **Positive:** Louisa_M says, "I like the idea of a gym" (line 10) and "I really think this gym is a great idea" (line 44).
*   ii) **Negative:** JonasJoy is against the idea due to cost ("Creating a gym will cost a fortune!") and suggests renovating the playground instead (lines 21-26).
*   iii) **Neutral:** ClariceCC states, "I’m not really bothered about what equipment we buy. I prefer to exercise outside" (lines 33-34). While she gives practical advice, her personal attitude towards the project is one of indifference.
*   iv) **Positive:** RedReader actively contributes ideas to make the gym better (lines 15-20) and later states, "I'm on board with FitBoy leading the project" (line 45).

*   v) **D** ClariceCC

**Reasoning:**

*   **Louisa_M -> B:** She suggests the roof because "It's nice and bright up there" (line 13) and criticizes the storeroom for not having "a lot of room" (line 11).

*   **JonasJoy -> A:** He suggests to "just focus on renovating the covered playground instead" (lines 23-24), which would involve redecorating/repainting.

<summary><b>Question 41</b></summary>
> Below are summaries of two possible pieces of equipment for the gym. Fill in the blanks with ONE word that best fits the paragraph. Your answers must be grammatically correct.

**Multi-function power tower**
The multi-function power tower is a great piece of equipment for increasing the (i) **strength** of your shoulders, chest and arms. By using the knee-raise station, you can also get a good (ii) **core** workout. Despite being (iii) **priced** in the mid-range, the quality and durability is excellent. However, this piece of equipment involves (iv) self-**assembly** which does require some skill.

**Treadmill**
The treadmill is an ideal piece of equipment for building (v) **cardio** fitness. The specially cushioned treadmill reduces the (vi) **impact** of running. You will find a (vii) **fan** built into the treadmill. It is useful if your exercise space does not have air-conditioning. You can also enjoy interactive workouts with this model—just tap the (viii) **touchscreen** to join classes with online coaches. Please note that because you cannot (ix) **fold** this model, a sizeable amount of room is required.

**Location/Reasoning:** The answers are taken directly from the descriptions for the "Multi-function power tower" and "Treadmill" in the Text 3 flyer.

<details>
<summary><b>Question 42</b></summary>
> Below is a table summarizing the information about four of the pieces of equipment. Complete all the boxes in the table by writing ‘Y’ for yes or ‘N’ for no.

| Name of equipment | Cheap to buy | Takes up a lot of space | High quality |
| :--- | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| i) dumb-bells | Y | N | N |
| ii) foldable workout bench | Y | N | N |
| iii) multi-function power tower | N | Y | Y |
| iv) elliptical trainer | N | Y | Y |

**Reasoning from Text 3:**

*   **foldable workout bench:** "Low in price" (Y), "Can be folded away" (N), "not particularly robust" (N).
*   **multi-function power tower:** "Mid-range in price" (N), "requires some room" (Y), "well manufactured and built to last" (Y).
*   **elliptical trainer:** "top of the price range" (N), "Requires a substantial amount of space" (Y), "top of the range" (Y).

> A multi-function power tower
> B treadmill

> A dumb-bell
> B foldable workout bench
> C multi-function power tower

**iii) Lisa:** has never been to a gym before and doesn’t know how to use any of the equipment. She wants to work on her legs, but doesn’t want to train her upper body. She is cautious about getting injured. Which piece of equipment suits her?
