Based on the field study materials (Tai Kiu Stream / Tai Tso Stream) and general ecological principles from the provided textbook chapters, here are suggested answers for your discussion.
根據提供的野外考察資料（大橋 / 大曹石澗）以及教科書章節中的一般生態學原理，以下是建議的討論答案。

### 1. In respect of physical factors and biotic factors, what differences have you found in the two sites? What do you think are the causes for these differences?
**Physical Factors:** Site 1 (likely upstream/riffle) usually has a faster water flow, higher dissolved oxygen, and larger rock particles; whereas Site 2 (likely downstream/pool) has slower flow and more sediment/mud.
**物理因子：** 地點一（通常是上游/急流）通常水流較快、溶解氧較高且石塊顆粒較大；而地點二（通常是下游/水潭）水流較慢，沉積物或泥沙較多。

**Biotic Factors:** The fast-flowing site often has animals with hooks or suckers (e.g., mayfly nymphs), while the slow-flowing site may have swimming animals or those that burrow in mud (e.g., worms).
**生物因子：** 水流急的樣點通常有具備鉤或吸盤的動物（如蜉蝣若蟲），而水流慢的樣點則可能有更多會游泳或鑽入泥中的動物（如蠕蟲）。

**Causes:** The main cause is the slope or topography of the stream bed, which creates differences in water flow rate, subsequently affecting oxygen levels and substrate type.
**成因：** 主要原因是河床的坡度或地形，這造成了水流速度的差異，繼而影響了含氧量和基層的類型。

### 2. Provide examples to explain how do the plants adapt to their living environment.
Some aquatic plants have flexible stems that bend with the water flow to reduce resistance and prevent breaking.
一些水生植物擁有柔韌的莖，能隨水流彎曲以減少阻力，防止折斷。

Plants rooted in the stream bank often have strong, extensive root systems to anchor themselves firmly in the soil and prevent being washed away during floods.
生長在河岸的植物通常有強壯且廣泛的根系，將自己牢固地抓緊在土壤中，防止在洪水期間被沖走。

### 3. Provide examples to explain how do the animals adapt to their living environment?
Many stream animals, such as the broken-band hillstream loach, have flattened bodies to hide under rocks and avoid the strong current.
許多溪流動物，例如擬平鰍，擁有扁平的身體，以便躲藏在石塊下並避開強烈的水流。

Some insects, like black fly larvae, use hooks or suckers to attach firmly to rock surfaces so they are not swept away.
一些昆蟲，如蚋的幼蟲，會利用鉤或吸盤緊緊吸附在岩石表面，以免被水沖走。

### 4. Briefly describe a few indicator organisms you found in the stream.
Stonefly nymphs and Mayfly nymphs are often indicators of clean water with high dissolved oxygen levels.
石蠅若蟲和蜉蝣若蟲通常是水質潔淨且溶解氧含量高的指標生物。

Conversely, the presence of large numbers of red sludge worms or bloodworms usually indicates polluted water with low oxygen levels.
相反，大量出現的顫蚯蚓或紅蟲通常顯示水質受污染且含氧量低。

### 5. Environment affects the living organisms, living organisms change the environment. Is that true?
Yes, abiotic factors like water flow determine which organisms can survive there (e.g., only strong swimmers in fast currents).
是的，非生物因子如水流決定了哪些生物能在該處生存（例如只有游泳能力強的生物能在急流中生存）。

Simultaneously, living organisms like dense vegetation can slow down water flow and trap sediments, physically altering the stream channel.
同時，生物如茂密的植被可以減緩水流並攔截沉積物，從而在物理上改變河道。

### 6. Give examples of symbiotic relations observed in the stream.
**Commensalism:** Algae growing on the shell of a snail; the algae get a surface to live on, while the snail is neither helped nor harmed.
**片利共棲：** 水藻生長在螺的殼上；水藻獲得棲息的表面，而螺既未受惠亦未受害。

**Predation:** Dragonflies nymphs feeding on smaller fish or tadpoles is a predator-prey relationship commonly seen in streams.
**捕食：** 蜻蜓稚蟲捕食小魚或蝌蚪是溪流中常見的捕食者與獵物關係。

### 7. How do human activities affect the stream directly and indirectly?
**Directly:** Dumping of sewage or household waste into the stream introduces pathogens and lowers water quality immediately.
**直接影響：** 將污水或家居廢物傾倒入溪流會引入病原體並立即降低水質。

**Indirectly:** Construction or deforestation nearby causes soil erosion, which leads to more suspended solids in the water, blocking sunlight for aquatic plants.
**間接影響：** 附近的建築工程或砍伐森林會導致水土流失，令水中的懸浮物增加，阻擋水生植物所需的陽光。

### 8. Is there any limitation of this field study? What would you suggest for further investigation?
**Limitation:** The study is a "snapshot" taken on a single day, so it does not account for seasonal variations (e.g., wet vs. dry season).
**局限：** 這項研究只是單日的「快照」，未能考慮季節性變化（例如雨季與旱季的分別）。

**Suggestion:** Repeat the study at different times of the year to observe how seasonal changes in water flow affect biodiversity.
**建議：** 在一年中的不同時間重複研究，以觀察水流的季節性變化如何影響生物多樣性。

### 9. Can you make any conclusion of this study?
We can conclude that the physical environment, particularly water flow rate and water quality, significantly determines the distribution and abundance of stream organisms.
我們可以總結出物理環境，特別是水流速度和水質，在很大程度上決定了溪流生物的分佈和豐度。

Areas with less human impact generally show higher biodiversity compared to areas near villages or construction sites.
受人類影響較少的區域，其生物多樣性通常比鄰近村落或建築工地的區域為高。
