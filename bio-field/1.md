Here are the key points formatted as 2 PPT slides in English.

### **Slide 1: Data Comparison (Physical & Biological)**

**1. Physical Environment Contrast**
*   **Water Flow Rate:**
    *   **Quadrat 1 (Q1):** 0 m/s (Stagnant/Pool).
    *   **Quadrat 2 (Q2):** 0.35 m/s (Fast flowing/Riffle).
*   **Temperature:**
    *   Q1 (19.8°C) is slightly warmer than Q2 (18.6°C) due to lack of water mixing.

**2. Organism Distribution**
*   **Exclusive Species:**
    *   **Hainan Sulcospira (Snail):** Found **only in Q1** (3 individuals).
    *   **Caddisfly Larva:** Found **only in Q2** (2 individuals).
*   **Common Species:**
    *   **Mayfly Nymph:** Found in both, but higher abundance in Q1 (5 vs 3).
*   **Overall Abundance:**
    *   Higher total count in Q1 (Slow water) than Q2 (Fast water).

### **Slide 2: Biological Explanation (Adaptation)**

**1. Impact of Water Flow (Key Factor)**
*   **Quadrat 1 (0 m/s) - The Pool:**
    *   **Stability:** Favors slow-moving animals like **Snails** that lack strong gripping mechanisms. They can graze on algae without being washed away.
    *   **Food Source:** Stagnant water allows organic debris (detritus) to settle, supporting detritivores like **Mayfly nymphs**.
*   **Quadrat 2 (0.35 m/s) - The Riffle:**
    *   **Physical Stress:** High current washes away unadapted species (e.g., Snails).
    *   **Adaptations Required:**
        *   **Caddisfly Larvae:** Possess **hooks/claws** or build weighted **cases** to anchor against the current.
        *   **Streamlined Bodies:** Necessary to reduce water resistance.

**2. Oxygen & Metabolism**
*   **Flowing Water (Q2):** Provides constant oxygen supply, essential for active predators or filter feeders like Caddisflies.
*   **Warmer Water (Q1):** May increase metabolic rates of ectotherms (like snails) in the quiet pool.
